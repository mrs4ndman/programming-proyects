## My programming sandbox
### They are nothing to take seriously, really simple and with little to no real world use

#### Proyect list:
- **Random-number-gen**
    - My first "real" programming proyect I have done at school
    - It uses random number generation to render out divs with said random colors
    - Just updated it after months (made it more complex)
<br>

- **CS50 files**
    - CS50X Weekly code examples
<br>

- **low-level**
    - Assembly, C and other stuff I'm trying out
<br>

- **DA1D1A-stuff**
    - PSeInt (pseudo-code) assignments from my CS degree.
